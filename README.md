An over-simplified ~~rip-off~~ veresion of an Android application from Google Play called **Clefs: Music Reading Trainer**.

So, the idea in general isn't mine and I do not claim it.

I just wanted to practice that on Windows. Conveniently.

Features
- Practice reading notes on treble and bass clefs;
- Daily statistics and overall history overview;
- Configurable clef switching frequency;
- Daily play streak indication;
- MIDI audio feedback (optional).

Tech Info
- Windows
- C++20
- Visual Studio 2022
- wxWidgets v3.3.1 (cofigured with $WX_DIR evironment variable in mind)
- RtMidi ($RTMIDI_DIR)
- <windows.h> for .wav
